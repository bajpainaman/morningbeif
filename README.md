# Daily Briefing AI Agent

**An AI agent that aggregates daily newsletters, research papers, and news articles, compiles them into a concise briefing, and integrates with Alexa to read it out every morning.**

## Overview

The Daily Briefing AI Agent is designed to be your personal news curator. It collects essential information from various sources—such as AI/ML research papers from Arxiv, top stories from Hacker News, daily newsletters, and even self-help articles—and compiles them into a structured summary. Every morning, this summary is delivered to your Alexa-enabled device so you can start your day informed.

## Features

- **Multi-Source Aggregation:**  
  Retrieves content from multiple sources via RSS feeds and public APIs.

- **Content Summarization:**  
  Uses state-of-the-art transformer models (e.g., Facebook BART) to automatically summarize lengthy articles and papers.

- **Customizable Compilation:**  
  Organizes content into sections (AI/ML research, tech news, personal development, etc.) and formats it into an HTML briefing.

- **Email & Alexa Integration:**  
  Sends the compiled briefing via email and supports integration with Alexa for voice playback each morning.

- **Local Execution:**  
  A fully self-contained script that runs locally and can be scheduled to execute automatically (using cron jobs, Task Scheduler, etc.).

## How It Works

1. **Data Fetching:**  
   The script uses tools like `feedparser` and `requests` to collect the latest content from your preferred sources.

2. **Content Summarization:**  
   Leverages Hugging Face's transformers to generate concise summaries of the fetched content.

3. **Compilation & Formatting:**  
   Aggregates the summaries into a single HTML document organized by topic.

4. **Delivery:**  
   Sends the compiled briefing via SMTP to your email and can trigger Alexa to read the briefing using an Alexa Skill.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Required Python packages: `feedparser`, `requests`, `transformers`, `torch`, etc.
- An email account configured with SMTP credentials.
- An Alexa-enabled device and a custom Alexa Skill set up for reading your daily briefing.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/daily-briefing-ai-agent.git
   cd daily-briefing-ai-agent
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Configure your settings in the script (email credentials, API endpoints, Alexa integration details).

### Running the Script

Execute the script manually:
```bash
python daily_briefing.py
```

To automate it, schedule the script to run every morning using cron (Linux/macOS) or Task Scheduler (Windows).

## Alexa Integration

Set up an Alexa Skill that accesses the daily briefing email or directly pulls the generated briefing from a hosted endpoint. Customize the Skill's invocation name and response handling to match your preferences.
